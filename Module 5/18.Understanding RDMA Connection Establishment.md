### Understanding RDMA Connection Establishment

RDMA code examples are useful, but before they can be utilized, an initial connection must be established with the other side. Connection-oriented transports necessitate this establishment between hosts before data can be transmitted. Each side must possess the address of the other side to establish this connection, creating a bit of a chicken-and-egg scenario.

#### Solutions to the Connection Establishment Challenge

1. **Out-of-Band Communication:**
   - This method involves using a different type of transport to exchange addresses before creating the RDMA connection. For instance, RC-ping-pong utilizes TCP sockets to exchange information such as the remote QP number.

2. **Communication Manager:**
   - This service offers solutions for both address exchange and connection establishment. It facilitates the exchange of necessary information before forming the RDMA connection.

#### Information Exchanged Before Connection Formation

Before a connection can be established, the following information needs to be exchanged:
- Layer two and three addresses (local and global identifiers, MAC and IP addresses)
- QP number (analogous to TCP port)
- Packet sequence number (similar to TCP sequence number)
- Agreement on communication details, including the path MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit) between the two points

#### Additional Details During Address Exchange

During the exchange of addresses, additional information for application use is typically sent, such as:
- Remote keys for registered buffers
- Additional requirements specific to different transport types, e.g., transmission count and timer values for RC QPs

**MTU:** Max Transfer Unit
