### RDMA Connection Manager (RDMA CM)

RDMA CM serves as the connection manager for RDMA, featuring both a user space library (not IB verbs) and a kernel space component. Its API is designed akin to the server-client model in TCP, with functions such as `rdma_connect`, `rdma_accept`, `rdma_bind`, and `rdma_listen`. Additionally, it integrates verbs-specific APIs like `rdma_create_qp` and `rdma_post_send`.

#### Key Features of RDMA CM API:

- **Event Channel:** Created at the application's inception and used throughout its runtime. It externalizes events like address resolution and incoming connections.

- **Connection Establishment:**
  - Similar to TCP, a server must bind and listen on a port.
  - A client then connects to this port to establish a connection.

#### Using the Connection:
- Once a connection is established, you can utilize either the RDMA CM API or the verbs API to communicate over this connection.
- Use `rdma_post_send()` or `IBV post_send` to send messages over the established connection.

#### RDMA CM API Functions:

- `rdma_connect()`: Initiates a connection to the remote server.
- `rdma_accept()`: Accepts the connection request from a remote client.
- `rdma_bind_addr()`: Sets the local port number to listen on.
- `rdma_listen()`: Starts listening for incoming connection requests.
- `rdma_create_qp()`: Allocates a Queue Pair (QP) for communication on the new rdma_cm_id.
- `rdma_post_send()`: Posts a buffer to send a message.

The RDMA CM simplifies the process of establishing and managing RDMA connections, providing a structured approach similar to traditional networking protocols.
