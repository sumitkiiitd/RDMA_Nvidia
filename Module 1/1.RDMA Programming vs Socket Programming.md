# RDMA Programming vs Socket Programming

Traditionally, most socket applications use the socket API (e.g., connect, accept, send, receive) to pass data between endpoints. RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) programming offers an alternative with better latency and hardware utilization, especially with compatible network interface cards.

## Concepts of RDMA Programming

RDMA programming relies on three key concepts:
1. **Transport Offload**: 
   - In socket applications, sending data involves OS overhead (network headers, data passing). 
   - RDMA's transport offload shifts this overhead to dedicated hardware, reducing latency and improving efficiency.

2. **Kernel Bypass**: 
   - Data in RDMA programming bypasses the OS kernel, going directly from user application to hardware.
   - This bypass enhances speed and reduces latency by avoiding OS processing.

3. **RDMA Operations and Atomics**: 
   - These are hardware-based operations that accelerate data transfer between endpoints efficiently.

## How Socket Applications Work

- Application sends data:
  - Buffer passed to socket library.
  - System call sends buffer to OS.
  - TCP stack passes to device driver.
  - Hardware finally sends the data.

## RDMA Programming Workflow

- Application passes buffer to RDMA library.
- RDMA library sends buffer directly to hardware.
- OS is bypassed, resulting in faster data transmission.
- Device drivers handle resource allocation and initial connection setup.

## Control Path vs Data Path

- **Control Path**: Handles setup and resource management, involves OS and device drivers.
- **Data Path**: Direct transmission of data bypassing OS for speed.
