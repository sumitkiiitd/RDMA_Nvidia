# Understanding RDMA and Communication Models

To understand RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) programming, we need to explore different communication models.

## Communication Models

### Two-Sided Communication
- **Participants**: Sender and Receiver
- **Operation**: Sender sends data, receiver accepts and places data in its memory.
- **Characteristics**: Both sender and receiver actively participate in data transfer.

### One-Sided Communication (RDMA)
- **Participants**: Sender and Receiver
- **Operation**: Sender sends data directly to receiver's designated memory space.
- **Characteristics**: Receiver remains inactive during data transfer, enhancing efficiency.

## RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access)

- **Definition**: RDMA stands for Remote Direct Memory Access.
- **Capability**: Supports the one-sided communication model where the sender directs data to the receiver's memory without receiver involvement.
- **Efficiency**: By eliminating receiver involvement, RDMA improves data transfer efficiency.
