# Memory Zero Copy in RDMA

In RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access), memory zero copy is a crucial concept, involving two primary techniques for data transfer: buffer copy and zero copy.

## Buffer Copy

- **Definition**: Involves temporary buffers on both sender and receiver sides.
- **Operation**: Data is broken down and copied to sender's temporary buffers, then sent to corresponding buffers on the receiver side, eventually copied to the destination in remote memory.
- **Use Case**: Typically used for small messages that fit into single buffers.

## Zero Copy

- **Definition**: Aims to minimize copies as much as possible.
- **Operation**: Sender notifies receiver of data intent without sending actual data. Once receiver is ready, it replies, and sender transfers data directly to remote memory using RDMA.
- **Flexibility**: Zero copy can operate in both sender-to-receiver and receiver-to-sender directions, depending on readiness.

## Primary Differences between Buffer Copy and Zero Copy

- **When sending a message**: Buffer Copy copies the user's buffer to another location in the system memory, while Zero Copy sends directly from the original buffer.
- **When receiving a message**: Buffer Copy requires an additional temporary buffer, while Zero Copy writes directly to the destination buffer for that message.
- **Overhead**: Zero Copy typically has lower overhead compared to Buffer Copy, which involves multiple memory copies.

## Achieving Zero Copy

- **Method**: By transferring data directly to the remote memory without intermediate copies.
- **Benefit**: Reduces latency and improves efficiency by minimizing data movement within the system.

### Summary of Questions:

1. **What is the primary difference between Buffer Copy and Zero Copy?**
   - A. When sending a message, Buffer Copy copies the user's buffer to another location in the system memory, while Zero Copy sends directly from the original buffer.
   - B. When receiving a message, Buffer Copy requires an additional temporary buffer, while Zero Copy writes directly to the destination buffer for that message.
   - C. Zero Copy has a lower overhead compared to Buffer Copy which copies messages to the RAM multiple times.
   - D. All of the Above
   <br> **Correct Answer**: D. All of the Above

2. **How is Zero Copy achieved?**
   - A. Using multiple copies to the RAM
   - B. By Transferring the data directly to the remote memory
   - C. By creating a public directory online and sharing it there
   - D. All of the above
   <br> **Correct Answer**: B. By Transferring the data directly to the remote memory
