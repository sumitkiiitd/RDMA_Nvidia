# Understanding Transport Offload and RDMA

## Responsibilities of the Transport Layer

The transport layer in networking has three main characteristics:
1. **Reliability**: Determines if messages sent via this transport are guaranteed to arrive at the destination.
2. **Connectivity**: Defines if the transport is connection-oriented (requiring a connection setup) or connectionless.
3. **Message vs Stream-based**: Specifies if the transport sends individual messages independently or as a continuous stream of data.

## Examples of Transports

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- **Reliability**: Reliable transport, ensures all messages arrive.
- **Connectivity**: Connection-oriented, requires a connection setup.
- **Message vs Stream-based**: Message-based, each message is distinct.

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- **Reliability**: Unreliable transport, does not guarantee delivery.
- **Connectivity**: Connectionless, no need for a connection setup.
- **Message vs Stream-based**: Message-based, each message is independent.

## Reliability Mechanisms

- **Reliability** ensures every sent message arrives; missing messages are detected and retransmitted.
- **Timeouts** trigger retransmission if acknowledgments are not received within a specific timeframe.

## RDMA Transports

RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) has two main types of transports:
- **RC (Reliable Connection)**: Similar to TCP, ensures reliable and ordered delivery, requires a connection setup.
- **UD (Unreliable Datagram)**: Similar to UDP, provides lower latency and is connectionless, messages are not guaranteed to arrive.
