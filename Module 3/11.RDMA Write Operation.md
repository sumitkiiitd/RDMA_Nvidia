# RDMA Write Operation

In RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access), RDMA Write is a one-sided operation where the sender initiates the transfer of data to a specified memory location on the receiver's side without the receiver's active involvement.

## RDMA Write Operation Overview

### Key Points
- **Operation Type**: One-sided communication initiated by the sender.
- **Process**:
  1. **Sender Action**:
     - Creates a message containing data and the destination memory address on the receiver side.
  2. **Receiver Side**:
     - Hardware locates the specified memory region and writes the incoming data to it.
     - Sends an acknowledgment back to the sender upon completion of the write operation.

### Detailed Steps
- **Sender's Role**:
  - Prepares a message with data and the destination memory address.
  - Initiates the RDMA Write operation to send data to the specified memory location on the receiver side.

- **Receiver's Role**:
  - Upon receiving the data, the hardware checks memory permissions.
  - Writes the received data to the specified memory location.
  - Sends an acknowledgment back to the sender confirming the completion of the write operation.

## Example Scenario
- **Sender**: Initiates RDMA Write operation with data and destination memory address.
- **Receiver**: Receives data, writes it to the specified memory, and sends acknowledgment.
