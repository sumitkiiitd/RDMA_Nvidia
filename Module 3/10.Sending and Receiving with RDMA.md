# Sending and Receiving with RDMA

In RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access), sending and receiving operations are essential for efficient data transfer.

## Send Operation

### Overview
- **Purpose**: Transmit data from sender to receiver using RDMA.
- **Process**:
  1. **Receiver Preparation**:
     - Post a receive work request (`RR`) with allocated buffers to receive incoming data.
  2. **Sender Action**:
     - Issue a send operation or work request (`SR`) with data to be sent.
     - Hardware processes the send operation, transmitting data to the receiver.
  3. **Completion**:
     - Receiver acknowledges data reception (in reliable transport).
     - Completion queue (`CQ`) entries notify software of send operation completion.

### Detailed Steps
- **Sender Side**:
  - Create a work request and post it on the send queue.
  - Hardware accesses and sends the data specified in the work request.
  - Generates a completion queue entry upon successful transmission.

- **Receiver Side**:
  - Post a receive work request (`RR`) indicating buffers ready to receive data.
  - Data sent by the sender arrives and is written into these allocated buffers.
  - Optionally, in reliable transport, an acknowledgment is sent back to the sender.

## Glossary
- **SR**: Send Request
- **RR**: Receive Request
- **CQ**: Completion Queue

## Recap Questions

1. **What is the purpose of posting a receive work request (`RR`) in RDMA?**
   - A. To acknowledge data reception.
   - B. To notify completion of send operations.
   - C. To allocate memory for data transmission.
   - D. To prepare to receive incoming data.
   - **Correct Answer**: D. To prepare to receive incoming data.

2. **When does the sender issue a send operation in RDMA?**
   - A. After receiving acknowledgment from the receiver.
   - B. Immediately after posting a receive work request.
   - C. Once the receiver posts a completion queue entry.
   - D. When data is ready to be transmitted.
   - **Correct Answer**: D. When data is ready to be transmitted.

3. **What is the role of the Completion Queue (CQ) in RDMA send operations?**
   - A. It allocates memory for incoming data.
   - B. It notifies software of send operation completion.
   - C. It handles data encryption during transmission.
   - D. It synchronizes sender and receiver clocks.
   - **Correct Answer**: B. It notifies software of send operation completion.

4. **In reliable transport with RDMA, what action does the receiver typically take after receiving data?**
   - A. Send an acknowledgment back to the sender.
   - B. Discard the received data if no errors are found.
   - C. Request additional data from the sender.
   - D. Update the send queue with new data.
   - **Correct Answer**: A. Send an acknowledgment back to the sender.
