### Atomic Operation in RDMA

Atomic operations in RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) leverage hardware capabilities to perform operations like fetch-and-add and compare-and-swap without interruption. These operations are crucial for ensuring data integrity and synchronization in distributed systems.

#### Key Characteristics of Atomic Operations

- **Hardware-Based**: Atomic operations rely on hardware support to execute multiple steps without interruptions.
- **Types**:
  - **Fetch-and-Add**: Involves fetching the current value of a memory location, adding a specified value to it, and storing the result atomically.
  - **Compare-and-Swap**: Compares the current value of a memory location with an expected value. If they match, it replaces the value with a new one.

#### Importance of Atomic Operations

Atomic operations are essential because they prevent interruptions during critical operations, ensuring that concurrent processes do not interfere with each other's data access or modifications. This capability enhances the reliability and consistency of data operations in RDMA applications.
