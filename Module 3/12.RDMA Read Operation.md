# RDMA Read Operation

RDMA Read is a one-sided operation in RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) where the sender initiates the retrieval of data from a specified memory location on the receiver's side without the active involvement of the receiver's software.

## RDMA Read Operation Overview

### Key Points
- **Operation Type**: One-sided communication initiated by the sender.
- **Process**:
  1. **Sender Action**:
     - Issues a message specifying the location and length of data it wants to read.
  2. **Receiver Side**:
     - Hardware reads the specified data from the memory location.
     - Sends the data back to the sender.

### Detailed Steps
- **Sender's Role**:
  - Sends an RDMA Read request specifying the location and length of data.
  
- **Receiver's Role**:
  - Hardware reads the data from the specified memory location.
  - Sends the read data back to the sender.

## Example Scenario
- **Sender**: Initiates RDMA Read operation to retrieve data from a specific memory location.
- **Receiver**: Hardware reads the requested data and sends it back to the sender.
