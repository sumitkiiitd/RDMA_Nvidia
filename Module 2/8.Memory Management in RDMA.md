# Memory Management in RDMA

In RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access), memory management differs significantly from traditional virtual memory systems.

## Virtual Memory in Operating Systems

- **Overview**: Operating systems manage virtual memory, mapping it to physical memory for processes.
- **Allocation**: Virtual memory is allocated in ranges, with permissions for read, write, or execute.

## Memory Registration in RDMA

- **Requirement**: RDMA requires pre-allocated memory registration.
- **Process**: Handled by the driver in the operating system's control path.
- **Properties of Registered Memory**:
  - **Protection**: Virtual addresses with specific access permissions.
  - **Memory Pinning**: Physical memory is locked in place.
  - **Translation Handle**: Used by hardware to access registered memory.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages**: Low latency access, memory always present in RAM.
- **Disadvantages**: Uses physical memory exclusively, potential contention with OS memory management.
