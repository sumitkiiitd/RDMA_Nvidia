# RDMA Verbs and Libibverbs

In RDMA programming, RDMA verbs play a crucial role as the API for RDMA applications.

## RDMA Verbs API

- **Definition**: RDMA verbs is the API used by RDMA applications to interact with RDMA-capable hardware.
- **Usage**: Applications utilizing RDMA must use the verbs API and link against the verbs library.
- **Divisions**:
  - **Control Path**: Involves resource allocation, modification, and destruction, typically handled by the operating system.
  - **Data Path**: Path where data is sent and received, optimized for high speed and efficiency.

## Characteristics of RDMA Verbs

- **Performance**: Designed for optimal latency, bandwidth, and message rate by leveraging hardware capabilities directly.
- **Versatility**: Suitable for various applications including client-server models, storage systems, AI, and parallel computing.

## Libibverbs

- **Definition**: Libibverbs is the user space library for RDMA applications.
- **Usage**: Applications need to link against Libibverbs to utilize RDMA operations effectively.
- **Availability**: Open source and supported across multiple Linux distributions.
- **Kernel Counterpart**: Exists for device drivers integrating RDMA capabilities at the kernel level.

### Summary of Concepts:

- **RDMA Verbs**: API for RDMA applications, optimizing both control and data paths for performance.
- **Libibverbs**: User space library enabling RDMA operations, essential for RDMA application development.
