# Recap: Important Verbs Objects in RDMA

In RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access), several key objects play crucial roles in sending and receiving messages efficiently.

## Important Verbs Objects

### Queue Pair (QP)
- **Function**: Transport endpoint similar to a socket in TCP.
- **Purpose**: Synchronized interface for sending and receiving messages.
- **Operation**: 
  - To send a message: Create a work request and post it on the work queue.
  - To receive a message: Create a work request and post it on the receive queue.
  - Both queues are part of the queue pair.

### Completion Queue (CQ)
- **Function**: Notifies when send or receive requests have been completed.
- **Usage**: Essential for handling completion notifications efficiently.

### Memory Region
- **Function**: Reference to registered memory.
- **Requirement**: Messages sent or received must use memory regions registered with the verbs API.
- **Role**: Ensures data integrity and efficiency in RDMA operations.
