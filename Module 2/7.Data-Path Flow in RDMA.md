# Data-Path Flow in RDMA

In RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access), data-path flow involves work requests, work completions, and various RDMA operations handled by hardware and software layers.

## RDMA Verbs and Data-Path Flow

### Software Level
- **Components**: Work requests and work completions.
- **Function**: Initiates and manages data transfer operations.

### Verbs Library Level
- **Role**: Interfaces between software and hardware layers, managing queues and operations.

### Hardware Level
- **Components**: QPs (Queue Pairs) and Completion Queues.
- **Function**: Executes data transfer operations with minimal latency.

## RDMA Operations

### Send Operation
- **Process**: Generates work requests for each message, posts to send queue, processes by hardware, and generates completion entries.

### RDMA Read Operation
- **Process**: Allocates buffers, creates work requests on receive queue, hardware places data in allocated buffer upon arrival, generates completion entries.

## Summary of Questions:

1. **What sections RDMA verbs typically divide into?**
   - A. Transfer Path, which governs how information would be routed and sent with as little latency as possible
   - B. Control Path, which governs how resources are created, modified or destroyed
   - C. Redundancy Path, which governs how data is stored, how many copies of it are generated in RAM, etc.
   - D. Data Path, which governs how data is sent and/or received
   - **Correct Answer**: A. Transfer Path, which governs how information would be routed and sent with as little latency as possible
                      B. Control Path, which governs how resources are created, modified or destroyed

2. **What are Work Requests?**
   - A. Requests from one application to another application.
   - B. Requests from the application for the hardware to execute.
   - C. Requests from the hardware for the application to execute.
   - D. Loopback Requests from the hardware to itself.
   - **Correct Answer**: B. Requests from the application for the hardware to execute.

3. **What information will a Work Completion contain?**
   - A. The status of its completion and additional information, such as the message length.
   - B. The number of outstanding work requests within the current work queue.
   - C. The individual components used to complete a work operation.
   - D. All of the above.
   - **Correct Answer**: A. The status of its completion and additional information, such as the message length.

4. **What is a QP?**
   - A. A send queue and a receive queue bound together, a Queue Pair.
   - B. Query Points, each returns a different value depending on syntax.
   - C. Queue Points, a dedicated area where messages pass before they're sent to their destination.
   - D. A Quarantine Protocol, to make sure harmful data is deactivated and cataloged for future reference.
   - **Correct Answer**: A. A send queue and a receive queue bound together, a Queue Pair.

5. **Which level is the first to detect an incoming message?**
   - A. Software level
   - B. Libibverbs
   - C. Hardware level
   - D. Verbs API
   - **Correct Answer**: C. Hardware level
