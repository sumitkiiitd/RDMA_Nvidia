# Verbs Objects in RDMA

In RDMA programming, several key objects within the verbs API facilitate efficient data transfer and management.

## Key Verbs Objects

### Work Requests
- **Definition**: Requests from the application to hardware to execute operations, typically RDMA operations.
- **Purpose**: Initiate data transfer or other operations.

### Work Completions
- **Definition**: Indicates the completion status of previous work requests, includes pointers to the completed work request and status information.
- **Role**: Allows applications to track and manage the completion of operations.

### Work Queues
- **Definition**: Objects where work requests are posted for hardware execution.
- **Types**:
  - **Send Queue**: Contains send requests for sending data to remote destinations.
  - **Receive Queue**: Used for receiving incoming data by posting buffers.

### Completion Queues
- **Definition**: Queues where work completions are posted by hardware and read by software.
- **Function**: Signals the completion of work requests and allows access to associated buffers.

### Queue Pairs
- **Definition**: A pair consisting of a Send Queue and a Receive Queue bound together.
- **Role**: Facilitates bidirectional communication between sender and receiver.

## Characteristics and Usage

- **Ordering**: Work requests on a single queue are executed in the order they were posted. However, multiple queues do not guarantee execution order based on posting order.
- **Management**: Each work request remains outstanding until a corresponding work completion is generated by the hardware.

### Summary of Verbs Objects:

- **Work Requests**: Initiate operations requested by the application.
- **Work Completions**: Signal the completion status of previous work requests.
- **Work Queues**: Post work requests for execution by hardware.
- **Completion Queues**: Collect work completions for software processing.
- **Queue Pairs**: Combine Send and Receive Queues for bidirectional data transfer.
